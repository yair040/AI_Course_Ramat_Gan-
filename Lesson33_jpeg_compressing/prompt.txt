Create PRD for Python program that works on WSL in virtual environment.
The main program will call tasks.
Each Python file no more than 150 lines.
The venv folder will be at ../../ of the current folder.
Create also Claude.md, planning.md and tasks.md.
Create also requirements.txt file for the virtual environment. 
The program will be created as a package including __init.py__ and the necessary settings.
The program will use relative paths and not absolute.
Use multiprocessing if it possible.
Use logging, starting from INFO level.
The log will be in the format of Ring buffer of 20 files.
Each file is up to 16MB.
When the last file is full the first file will 

The program will do:
1. Compress an image with jpeg.
2. Decompress the jpeg to original picture.
3. Find the difference (error) between the 2 pictures.
   Since we want to evaluate the error in different settings, use abs or square, what is more appropriate.
4. For steps 1 to 3 above, repeat on different Q (Quality) level of compressing.
   Use 10 different Q levels.
5. Draw an histogram of picture bytes before compressing (one column) and after compressing as depended on Q.
6. Draw an histogram of error between original picture and picture after decompressing as depended in Q.

Look and decide what Q you prefer.
