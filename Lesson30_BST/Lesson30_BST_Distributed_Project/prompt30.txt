1. Take the PRD file (of Deep Fake project) that located at ../../Lesson26/Lesson26_DeepFake/prd.md and use it to divide it to subprojects that will ordered in BST (Binary Search Tree) folder structure.
2. The BST will be 5 levels deep (16 leaves).
3. Each node (if possible) has its token numbers handler, logs, status, configuration, PRD, to do list, requirement and source code.
These will be handled in files.
4. Put the root in the current folder (Lesson30_BST_Distributed_Project).
Under the root will be all other folders.
5. modules that communicate with external world (like read file etc.) will be located in the leaves.
6. The code in the nodes will not be duplicated.
7. Folder names:
A leaf folder will be named as 1_xx while xx is the leaf number from 01 to 16.
The layer above is 2_xx while xx from 01 to 08.
The root folder will be 5_01.
8. Each level has (if required) a shared folder with all things that are common to all layers below.
9. When a decision in a leaf is required it will delivered to the layer above to decide if to decide there or deliver upwards.
10. The logs will be aggregated and filtered in each level before delivering to the level above.
The same is for the status and number of token used.
11. create test scenarios that test the whole BST tree or parts of it, but cover the whole BST.
Define the input and required output.
Simulate without code implemented to see if there are issues and all modules are used.
