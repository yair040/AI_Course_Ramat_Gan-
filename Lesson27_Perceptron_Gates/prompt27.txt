Create PRD for Python program that works on WSL in virtual environment.
The main program will call tasks.
Each Python file no more than 150 lines.
The venv folder will be at ../../ of the current folder.
Create also Claude.md, planning.md and tasks.md.
Create also requirements.txt file for the virtual environment. 
The program will be created as a package including __init.py__ and the necessary settings.
The program will use relative paths and not absolute.
Use multiprocessing if it possible.
Use logging, starting from INFO level.
The log will be in the format of Ring buffer of 20 files.
Each file is up to 16MB.
When the last file is full the first file will start to be overwritten.
The log files will be in the "log" subfolder.

Using Keras library neural network by perceptrons.
You have the AND problem and the XOR problem.
1. Plan a network with minimum of perceptrons to implement AND and XOT gates.
   When using Keras, you need to define number of layers and number of perceptrons in each layer.
   Need also to define the activation function.
2. Create Dataset of XOR and of AND gates.
3. Add random noise to the datasets.
   The noise will be positive and result close to the real points (15%). 
   Add the noise to the real Truth Table of AND gate and XOR gate.
   Create 600 samples for AND gate dataset and 600 samples for XOR gate dataset.
4. Use the Error function as the min square error: (expected-result)^2
   Set the Learning step as the default.
5. Draw the network schema with perceptrons including input, weights, output and connections between the layers.
6. Draw the points to see the points' clouds.
