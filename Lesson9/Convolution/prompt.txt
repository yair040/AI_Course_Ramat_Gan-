Create python program that: 

1. Creates sinus signal x (vector), 10 cycles, amplitude -1 to +1.

   Each cycle is 2 pi.

   For each cycle save 200 samples.

 2. Create h vector that contains 30 samples around the peak (included) of the previous x signal.

 3. Run convolution between x and h to get a output signal that will discover the 10 peak points.

 4. Draw the sinus graph and also the output vector that discovers the peaks.
