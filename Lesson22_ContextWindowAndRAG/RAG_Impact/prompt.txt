Create PRD for Python program that works on WSL in virtual environment.
The main program will call tasks.
Each Python file no more than 150-200 lines.
Create also Claude.md, planning.md and tasks.md.
Create also requirements.txt file for the virtual environment. 
The program will be created as a package including __init.py__ and the necessary settings.
The program will use relative paths and not absolute.
Use multiprocessing if it possible.
Use logging, starting from INFO level.
The log will be in the format of Ring buffer of 20 files.
Each file is up to 16MB.
When the last file is full the first file will start to be overwritten.
The log files will be in the "log" subfolder.
All documents and Python files will be located in the current working directory.
The logs will be at ./logs folder.

Since we want to delete the Context Window after each test, we will use Anthropic API.
The Anthropic API key is located at current folder as "api_key.dat".
Use Claude Haiku 3.5 to save money on tokens.
Do not expose the Anthropic API Key.

The purpose of the program is to test the hypothesis that using RAG to search a query is more probable to succeed and more rapid than loading the whole files in the context window. 

1. There are 20 pdf documents located at ./docs folder.
2. The program will compare 2 methods to retrieve data from these documents by a query:
   a. Using all documents loaded to the Context Window.
   b. Preparing RAG for these documents in local computer and query the RAG so only the most relevant 3
      chunks will be in the Context Window.
4. The main program will first check the first method:
   a. Load the documents from "/docs" subfolder into the Context Window by Anthropic API.
   b. query in the Context Window: "What are the side effects of taking calcium carbonate?"
   c. Get the result (answer).
   d. Measure the time from start of query till getting the result and save it.
   e. Save the result of the query.
5. The main program will do the same as step 4, but now using the RAG (second method):
   a. Load the documents from "/docs" subfolder into RAG by the appropriate procedure. 
   b. query in the Context Window by Anthropic API: "What are the side effects of taking calcium carbonate?"
   c. Get the result (answer).
   d. Measure the time from start of query till getting the result and save it.
   e. Save the result of the query.
6. Repeat on each method 5 times to get some statistics.
7. Summarize and show the results graphically.
   Retrieve time for the 2 methods.
   Compare and show the results from the query for the 2 methods.
