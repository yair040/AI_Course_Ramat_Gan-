      "answer": "Based on the safety data sheets and fact sheets provided, here are the potential side effects of calcium carbonate:\n\nIrritation and Mild Side Effects:\n1. Eye irritation\n2. Skin irritation\n3. Respiratory tract irritation (may cause coughing)\n4. Possible mild gastrointestinal effects\n\nPotential Serious Effects with High Exposure:\n1. At very high levels, calcium carbonate could potentially cause:\n- Damage to internal organs\n- Interruption of normal bodily functions\n- Risk of health complications\n\nSafety Precautions:\n1. Avoid dust formation\n2. Use personal protective equipment if handling large quantities\n3. Wash hands after handling\n4. Seek medical attention if significant exposure occurs\n\nWorkplace Exposure Limits:\n- OSHA recommends a maximum exposure of:\n  - 15 mg/m³ (total particulate)\n  - 5 mg/m³ (respirable fraction)\n\nMedical Recommendations:\n- If significant exposure occurs, consult a healthcare professional\n- Monitor for signs of respiratory or skin irritation\n- Wash exposed skin thoroughly\n- Rinse eyes with water if contact occurs\n\nThe documents emphasize that for typical dietary or small-scale usage, calcium carbonate is generally considered safe when used as directed.",
