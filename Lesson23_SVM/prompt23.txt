Create PRD for Python program that works on WSL in virtual environment.
The main program will call tasks.
Each Python file no more than 150 lines.
The venv folder will be at ../../ of the current folder.
Create also Claude.md, planning.md and tasks.md.
Create also requirements.txt file for the virtual environment. 
The program will be created as a package including __init.py__ and the necessary settings.
The program will use relative paths and not absolute.
Use multiprocessing if it possible.
Use logging, starting from INFO level.
The log will be in the format of Ring buffer of 20 files.
Each file is up to 16MB.
When the last file is full the first file will start to be overwritten.
The log files will be in the "log" subfolder.

The purpose of the program is to classify the Iris dataset.
The Iris dataset is found at ./iris.csv.
Since the Iris dataset contains 3 classes and SVM classify 2 classes, the classification will be done by 2 steps:
1. divide the 3 classes to 2 groups, one contains one class and the second group contains 2 classes.
   Then use SVM to classify these 2 groups.
   Till now one class is classify and need now to separate between the other 2 classes that located in one group.
2. Take the group that contains the 2 classes and run SVM on it.
   Now you gets separation of the other 2 classes.
The training will be on 75% of the dataset.
After training, test the SVM classification on the other 25% of the dataset.
The main program will repeat the above 5 times for statistics.
Summarize the results and show the results graphically.
