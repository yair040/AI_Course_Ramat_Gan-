1. Author is Yair Levi
2. Create PRD in English for Python program in Google Colab.
3. The title is "Machine that finds a rule from data".
4. It is a demo code. 
5. Purpose of the PRD is to define how to create the project that was described in the presentation.
6. The program implements the attached presentation.
7. Keras is required.
8. The implementation is by neurons like in deep learning, but not Perceptrons, means without activation function. 
9. Use Adam optimizer from Keras with step learning of 0.1.
10. Each time put single scalar and check if the out is as expected.
11. The input and output data are known ahead:
   The input array: celsius_q = np.array([-40, -10, 0, 8, 15,22,38], dtype=float)
   The output array: fahrenheit_a = np.array([-40, 14, 32, 46.4, 59,71.6,100], dtype=float)
12. No noise injection.
13. Use metrics as MSE (Mean Squared Error).
14. I assume backpropogation is necessary.
15. Run 500 epochs on the dataset.
16. 2 tasks: 
    a. find the target with one neuron. 
    b. find the target with more than one neuron.
17. Show the error graph by Keras.
18. Print the rule (equation) that was found.
19. The program should draw the neuron network (include input, output and weights) for each of the 2 tasks.
20. After the training, test the model on 100 degrees celsius.
21. Calculate the error from the real result.
22. Do not use files but instead functions.
23. The main program will call tasks.
24. Each Python function no more than 150 lines.
25. Use multiprocessing if it possible.
26. Use logging, starting from INFO level.
    The log will be in the format of Ring buffer of 20 files.
    Each file is up to 16MB.
    When the last file is full the first file will start to be overwritten.
    The log files will be in the "log" subfolder.
