prepare PRD document that will create in Python a program of a rectangular rotating through its center.
The rectangle will be 2x4 units and its center is on the origin of the coordinate system.
The rectangle lines will be pointed in blue and the corner points of the rectangle in red.
Make the axes of the coordinate system equal in size.
Title of the picture will be "Rotate Rectangle" in red.
The rectangle will be rotate each step by pi/128 radians.
Do this in 200 steps while delay of 10 milliseconds between each step.
The rectangle corners points should be placed in a vector while the first point will be also copied as last point to close the lines in the picture.
Create a matrix 4x4 that will present the rotation by pi/128 radians.
The new points for the next step will be calculated by multiply the matrix in the current points vector to get the new points vector.
