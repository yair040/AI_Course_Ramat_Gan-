Author: Yair Levi
The program will run on virtual platform, create requirement.txt for that.
The program will create 3 clusters of points on x,y axis, all of them on normal distribution.
Each cluster should has different standard error and mean.
Total number of points should be 6000, each cluster 2000 points.
2000 points should be overlapped by all three clusters.
Print a graph of the points with cluster barrier demonstration.
