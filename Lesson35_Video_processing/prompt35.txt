Create PRD for Python program that works on WSL in virtual environment.
The main program will call tasks.
Each Python file no more than 150 lines.
The venv folder will be at ../../ of the current folder.
Create also Claude.md, planning.md and tasks.md.
Create also requirements.txt file for the virtual environment. 
The program will be created as a package including __init.py__ and the necessary settings.
The program will use relative paths and not absolute.
Use multiprocessing if it possible.
Use logging, starting from INFO level.
The log will be in the format of Ring buffer of 20 files.
Each file is up to 16MB.
When the last file is full the first file will start to be overwritten.
The log files will be in the "log" subfolder.

The program:
The main program has 3 tasks.
Use FFMPEG or ffprobe as required
1. Get a video file and show in a friendly readable format all next parameters:
   a. Container format.
   b. Duration.
   c. Video & Audio streams.
   d. Width and Height.
   e. Resolution.
   f. Pixel format.
   g. Bitrate.
   h. Audio: Audio Codec, sample rate, channels, bitrate.
   i. GOP Composition: I-Frame, B-Frame and P-Frame.
   j. Number of GOPs.
   k. Show frame timestamps + types.
2. Isolate the frames from the video and store them in ./decoded_frames/ folder. 
   Ask the FFMPEG to draw the macro blocks on the frames  and label the moving vectors of each frame.
   Look at the frame and check if you see a moving flow.
   The vector length meaning is the speed of movement.
3. Draw an black object, size 20x10 pixels moving in the frames, from top left to bottom right, 
   so it will move in the video.
