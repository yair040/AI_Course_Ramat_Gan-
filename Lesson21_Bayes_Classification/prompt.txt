Create PRD for Python program that works on WSL in virtual environment.
The main program will call tasks.
Each Python file no more than 150-200 lines.
Create also Claude.md, planning.md and tasks.md.
Create also requirements.txt file for the virtual environment. 
The program will be created as a package including __init.py__ and the necessary settings.
The program will use relative paths and not absolute.
Use multiprocessing if it possible.
Use logging, starting from INFO level.
The log will be in the format of Ring buffer of 20 files.
Each file is up to 16MB.
When last file is full the first file will start to overwritten.
The log files will be in the "log" subfolder.

The project should classify Iris flowers by Naive Bayes algorithm.
The dataset is found as iris.csv.
The dataset contains of 4 features columns and last label column.
The first row is a header describing the columns names.
The 4 features are: septal length, septal width, petal length and petal width.
The last column is the label that is one of three classes: setosa, versicolor or virginica.

1. Divide the dataset randomly to 75% training and 25% test.
   Remove the label (class) in the test set from last column.
2. run the training on the training set in 2 different ways:
The first way, without using the libraries.
Use only NumPy library. 
Use the calculations as detailed below.
a. For the training group, calculate for each class (of the 3 classes) the probability that a random Iris will be found at this class.
This probability is P(Ci), while Ci is a specific class (i is the index).
Show P(Ci) for each class.
This is done by counting number of flowers in this class dividing to the total number of Iris.
b. Each row (flower) has 4 features.
For each class pass on each feature Xi (i is the index) and build an histogram for it, related the values at Xi.
Since each class has 4 features, we get 4 histograms (one for each Xi).
Since we have 3 classes, we get 12 histograms.
if there is an empty bin in the histogram, put there 1.
Show for each Xi feature the histogram for all classes for this Xi in the same graph. 
So, we will get 4 graphs.
Till here is the training step of the first method (way).

The second way, use classification method by Naive Bayes and use ready libraries for that training.
Use the same training set as above, do not choose random again.

3. run the test (classification) in 2 different ways:
Run the test on the test set (after dividing it earlier).
For each sample need to find the label or class it is belonged to, so need to remove the label of it before testing.
The first way, without using the libraries:
Use only NumPy library. 
Use the calculations as detailed below:
For each sample from the test set, calculate its probability to be in each class of the 3 classes.
The highest probability will be the label or class of the sample.
First for the sample for each of its feature, take the value of the feature and find where it is located in the histogram bin from the training step.
Do it for each of the classes (3 classes).
Now calculate the probability of this bin by dividing its area by the total area of the histogram. 
Do it for each of the classes (3 classes).
So, for each feature of the sample, Xi, you calculate P(Xi|Ci).
We have found previously P(Ci) the probability to be randomly to be in class Ci (for all 3 classes).
Use the logarithmic form of the Naive Bayes algorithm to find the sample to be in each class:
P(Ci|X) = log(P(Ci)) + Σ log(P(Xi|Ci))
Take the highest probability as the class label for the feature.

The second way, use classification method by Naive Bayes and use ready libraries for that test.
Use the same test set as above, do not choose random again.

At the end show the Confusion matrix for both methods.
