Create PRD for Python program that works on WSL in virtual environment.
The main program will call tasks.
Each Python file no more than 150 lines.
The venv folder will be at ../../ of the current folder.
Create also Claude.md, planning.md and tasks.md.
Create also requirements.txt file for the virtual environment. 
The program will be created as a package including __init.py__ and the necessary settings.
The program will use relative paths and not absolute.
Use multiprocessing if it possible.
Use logging, starting from INFO level.
The log will be in the format of Ring buffer of 20 files.
Each file is up to 16MB.
When the last file is full the first file will start to be overwritten.
The log files will be in the "log" subfolder.

The program will triangle in an image:
1. Create a image with a triangle, the triangle should be inside white and outside black.
2. Apply low pass filter for edge finding on that image.
3. Apply iFFT to get back an image with edges.
4. Apply a threshold to get binary picture.
5. Show me the picture and let me change the threshold and see the updated picture (in a loop).


5. Play with the threshold, so we see the triangle.
6. Draw again the final triangle to see it, while the positive Y axis is downward.
7. Find the triangle mathematically:
   a. By Hough algorithm find 3 lines.
   b. Find 3 different points that are common to 2 edges, these are the triangle vertices.
   c. Print the vertices coordinates.
