Create PRD for Python program that works on WSL in virtual environment.
The main program will call tasks.
Each Python file no more than 150 lines.
The venv folder will be at ../../ of the current folder.
Create also Claude.md, planning.md and tasks.md.
Create also requirements.txt file for the virtual environment. 
The program will be created as a package including __init.py__ and the necessary settings.
The program will use relative paths and not absolute.
Use multiprocessing if it possible.
Use logging, starting from INFO level.
The log will be in the format of Ring buffer of 20 files.
Each file is up to 16MB.
When the last file is full the first file will start to be overwritten.
The log files will be in the "log" subfolder.

The program will apply filters to an image:
1. Convert the image to frequency by FFT.
2. Show the frequencies in the image.
3. Throw the low frequency by HPF filter.
4. Convert back by iFFT and we get the picture back.
5. Ask to show the picture.
6. After step "b" above till "e", apply BPF band pass filter.
7. After step "b" above till "e", apply HPF high pass filter.
