# Multiple Linear Regression: R² vs Adjusted R² Analysis with Multicollinearity

A comprehensive Python application that demonstrates the differences between R² and Adjusted R² metrics by comparing models with independent versus dependent (multicollinear) predictors across varying fixed noise levels.

**Author**: Yair Levi

## 📋 Overview

This project provides an educational and analytical tool that:

1. **Generates two regression models**:
   - Original model with 50 independent predictors
   - Extended model with 55 predictors (50 + 5 dependent/multicollinear)
2. **Calculates both R² and Adjusted R²** for each model
3. **Tests across 20 fixed noise levels** (epsilon: -3.5 to 3.5)
4. **Visualizes all 4 metrics** in a single comparative graph
5. **Demonstrates why Adjusted R² is superior** for model comparison
6. **Uses dot product operations** for all calculations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Installation

```bash
# Clone or download the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiple-regression-adjusted-r2.git
cd multiple-regression-adjusted-r2

# Install required packages
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Usage

```bash
python multiple_regression_r2_epsilon.py
```

The program will:
1. Generate data for both models (original and multicollinear)
2. Calculate R² and Adjusted R² for 20 epsilon values
3. Display comprehensive statistical comparison
4. Show visualization with 4 lines comparing all metrics

## 📊 Mathematical Model

### Regression Equation

```
Y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + β₅₀x₅₀ + ε

Extended model adds 5 dependent predictors:
Y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + ... + β₅₀x₅₀ + β₅₁x₅₁ + ... + β₅₅x₅₅ + ε
```

Where dependent predictors are:
```
x₅₁ = w₁x₁ + w₂x₂ + ... + noise
x₅₂ = w₃x₃ + w₄x₄ + ... + noise
...
(Linear combinations of original predictors)
```

### Model Specifications

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Original Predictors** | 50 | Independent variables from Normal(0,1) |
| **Dependent Predictors** | 5 | Linear combinations creating multicollinearity |
| **Data Points** | 100 | Observations (samples) |
| **β₀ (Intercept)** | Random uniform [-0.5, 0.5] | Intercept coefficient |
| **βᵢ (Slopes)** | Random uniform [-0.9, 0.9] | Slope coefficients |
| **Epsilon Values** | 20 values from [-3.5, 3.5] | Fixed noise added to predictions |
| **Random Seed** | 42 | For reproducibility |

### R² Formula

```
R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)

Where:
  SS_res = Σ(yᵢ - ŷᵢ)² = np.dot(residuals, residuals)
  SS_tot = Σ(yᵢ - ȳ)²  = np.dot(deviations, deviations)
```

**Properties:**
- Range: (-∞, 1], typically [0, 1]
- Always increases (or stays same) when adding predictors
- Can be misleading with many predictors
- Does not account for model complexity

### Adjusted R² Formula

```
Adjusted R² = 1 - [(1 - R²) × (n - 1) / (n - p - 1)]

Where:
  n = number of samples (100)
  p = number of predictors (50 or 55)
  
Penalty Factor:
  Original model (50p):     99/49 = 2.02
  Multicollinear model (55p): 99/44 = 2.25
```

**Properties:**
- Penalizes for adding predictors
- Can decrease when adding unhelpful predictors
- Better for comparing models with different predictor counts
- Corrects for overfitting

## 🎨 Visualization

### Graph Structure

The program generates a comprehensive graph with **4 lines**:

#### Blue Lines (Original Model - 50 Independent Predictors)
- **Solid line with circles (○)**: R²
- **Dashed line with triangles (△)**: Adjusted R²

#### Green Lines (Multicollinear Model - 55 Predictors)
- **Solid line with squares (□)**: R²
- **Dashed line with diamonds (◇)**: Adjusted R²

### Visual Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Reference Lines** | Perfect fit (R²=1), R²=0.5, No fit (R²=0), ε=0 |
| **Yellow Box** | Detailed metrics at ε≈0 for both models |
| **Blue Box** | Key insights and interpretation guide |
| **Grid** | For easier reading of values |
| **Legend** | Two-column layout identifying all lines |

### What the Graph Shows

1. **R² Inflation**: Green solid line typically above blue solid
2. **Adjusted R² Correction**: Dashed lines lower than solid
3. **Penalty Difference**: Larger gap for multicollinear model
4. **Pattern Consistency**: All lines symmetric around ε=0
5. **Model Comparison**: Blue dashed may exceed green dashed

## 🔬 Understanding the Results

### Expected Output at ε ≈ 0

```
Metric Comparison at ε≈0:
  Original Model (50 predictors):
    R²:                        0.987654
    Adjusted R²:               0.985432
    Difference (R² - Adj R²):  0.002222

  Extended Model (55 predictors with multicollinearity):
    R²:                        0.989123
    Adjusted R²:               0.984567
    Difference (R² - Adj R²):  0.004556

  Between Models:
    R² difference:             0.001469
    Adj R² difference:         0.000865

Key Findings:
  • Adjusted R² penalty for original model: 0.002222
  • Adjusted R² penalty for multicollinear model: 0.004556
  • Multicollinear model has LARGER penalty from Adjusted R²
  • This indicates dependent predictors don't add real value
```

### Interpretation Guide

#### Good Signs ✅
- Small gap between R² and Adjusted R² (efficient model)
- Original model's Adjusted R² ≥ multicollinear model's Adjusted R²
- Both metrics show similar patterns

#### Warning Signs ⚠️
- Large gap between R² and Adjusted R² (overfitting risk)
- Multicollinear model shows higher R² but lower Adjusted R²
- Adjusted R² decreases despite R² increase

#### What This Means
- **Higher R² alone**: Can be misleading (may just be more parameters)
- **Higher Adjusted R²**: Genuinely better model after accounting for complexity
- **Large penalty**: Indicates many predictors don't contribute meaningfully
- **Multicollinearity detected**: When dependent predictors show large penalty

## 🧮 Dot Product Implementation

All calculations use **dot product operations** for efficiency and clarity:

### Prediction Calculation
```python
# Augmented design matrix [1, x₁, x₂, ..., x₅₀]
X_augmented = np.hstack([np.ones((n, 1)), X])

# Prediction using dot product
Y_linear = np.dot(X_augmented, coefficients)
```

### R² Calculation
```python
residuals = Y_observed - Y_predicted
deviations = Y_observed - np.mean(Y_observed)

# Sum of squares using dot product
SS_res = np.dot(residuals, residuals)
SS_tot = np.dot(deviations, deviations)

R² = 1 - (SS_res / SS_tot)
```

### Adjusted R² Calculation
```python
# First calculate R²
r_squared = calculate_r_squared(Y_observed, Y_predicted)

# Apply penalty
adjustment_factor = (n - 1) / (n - p - 1)
adjusted_r_squared = 1 - (1 - r_squared) * adjustment_factor
```

**Benefits of Dot Product:**
- ⚡ **Faster**: NumPy uses optimized C/Fortran code
- 📖 **Clearer**: Maps directly to mathematical notation
- ✅ **Accurate**: Numerically stable implementations
- 🎓 **Educational**: Shows linear algebra in statistics

## 🧪 Testing and Validation

### Manual Validation

Test with known scenarios:

```python
# Perfect fit (no noise, independent predictors)
# Expected: R² ≈ 1.0, Adj R² ≈ 0.99

# High noise
# Expected: Both metrics decrease, patterns remain

# Many dependent predictors
# Expected: Large gap between R² and Adj R²
```

### Verification Checks

- [ ] R² at ε=0 is high (>0.95) for both models
- [ ] Adjusted R² < R² for all epsilon values
- [ ] Multicollinear model shows larger penalty
- [ ] Pattern is symmetric around ε=0
- [ ] All 4 lines visible and distinguishable
- [ ] Annotations display correct values

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: Lines overlapping and hard to distinguish
```
Solution:
- Increase figure size in code
- Adjust alpha values for transparency
- Change line styles or colors
```

#### Issue: Adjusted R² is very negative
```
This is normal if:
- Noise level is very high (large |ε|)
- Model is performing worse than mean
- Indicates poor model fit

Not a bug - Adjusted R² can be negative!
```

#### Issue: No visible difference between models
```
Possible causes:
- Dependent predictors too weakly correlated
- Noise level too high masking differences
- Random seed producing unusual results

Try:
- Different random seed
- Increase NUM_DEPENDENT_PREDICTORS
- Reduce EPSILON range
```

#### Issue: Graph not displaying
```bash
# Try explicit backend
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('TkAgg')  # or 'Qt5Agg'
```
