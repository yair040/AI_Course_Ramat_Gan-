prepare a python program that creates a table with 6 features starting from "a" to "f".
5000 rows, 
Create this 2 dimensional array by NumPy. 
This will be the dataset table.
Fill this array with 0 and 1 randomly with the next constraints:
column 1:  80% are 1.
column 2:  60% are 1.
column 3:  40% are 1.
column 4:  30% are 1.
column 5:  20% are 1.
column 6:  10% are 1.
Find association rules that have:
Support > 30%
Confidence > 70 %.
Print the Support, Confidence and lift.
For calculation of Support , Confidence and lift, use the equations and not libraries.
